Feature: packaged sensor plugins
  
  
  # Scenario: sensors should load when starting
  #     Given an instance of NimbusPI
  #      When the instance is started
  #      Then the sensor list should not be empty
  #       And there should be no warnings
  #
  #
  # Scenario: sensors should raise an exception if their get_state is not implemented
  #     Given an instance of NimbusPI
  #       And a new sensor named "foobar"
  #      When accessing the "foobar" sensor state
  #      Then an exception should be thrown
  #
  #
  # Scenario: no sensors should be activated after initialization
  #     Given an instance of NimbusPI
  #      Then the sensor list should be empty
  #       And there should be no warnings
  #
  #
  # Scenario: sensors should be activated after starting
  #     Given an instance of NimbusPI
  #      When the instance is started
  #      Then the sensor list should not be empty
  #       And there should be no warnings
  #
  #
  # Scenario Outline: all sensors should return standard states by default when activated
  #             Given an instance of NimbusPI
  #              When the "<plugin>" sensor is activated
  #               And accessing the "<plugin>" sensor state
  #              Then the state should be "<response>"
  #
  #         Examples: Sensors
  #                   | plugin     | response     |
  #                   | helloworld | Hello World! |
  #
  #
  # Scenario: stopping the service should unload all sensors
  #     Given an instance of NimbusPI
  #      When the instance is started
  #       And the instance is stopped
  #      Then the service should not be running
  #       And there should be no warnings
  #       And the sensor list should be empty
  #
  #
  # Scenario: activating an already-active sensor should throw a warning
  #     Given an instance of NimbusPI
  #      When the instance is started
  #       And the "helloworld" sensor is activated
  #      Then a warning should be logged that says "Cannot activate sensor 'helloworld' - sensor already active"
  #
  #
  # Scenario: deactivating an inactive sensor should throw a warning
  #     Given an instance of NimbusPI
  #      When the "helloworld" sensor is deactivated
  #      Then a warning should be logged that says "Cannot deactivate sensor 'helloworld' - sensor not active"
